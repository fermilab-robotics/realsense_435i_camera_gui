# realsense_435i_camera_gui
Based off of the work done by Maryum Fatima SU22 with the goal of adding a PyQt5 GUI to the camera display.

#PyQtGUI.py is the file that gives functionality to the GUI, aka the Main. 
#The actual GUI is the GUI.py file
#The PyQt5GUI.ui file is the designer file that then gets converted to the GUI.py file
#Conversion command: pyuic5 -x PyQt5GUI.ui -o GUI.py
